# Classification-Of-Bees
Classification of bumble bees and honey bees by using convolutional neural networks.

In this project, I have built a Convolutional Neural Network to classiffy (binary classification) bees. 
I first came across the project on DataCamp, but I used a totally different method from them.
I downloaded the dataset from Github by searching the project name, because DataCamp does not provide it. I downsampled the dataset with the notebook which is named
"Creation_of_New_Dataset.ipynb". However directories should be fixed if you want to use that notebook again. 
Then there are two other notebooks that are of neural network architecture. One of them includes regularization method(L2 regularization), while the other does not. 

This project is done for Artificial Neural Networks course of my graduate education, and has a powerpoint slide and an exhaustive report which is not included here.
